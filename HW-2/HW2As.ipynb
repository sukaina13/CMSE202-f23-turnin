    "[The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is an example of cellular automation which was devised by the mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game is played on a rectangular grid of \"cells\". Each cell is adjacent to up to eight neighbor cells. Initially, each cell is either alive or dead. At each timestep, the states (alive/dead) of the cells update simultaneously according to the following rules:\n",

    "&#9989;  **Question 3.5 (5 points)**: There are over 100 FBS teams, but each team only gets to play a few of the other teams. However, fans still want to be able to argue that their team is better than another team, even if their team didn't play and beat that other team. One way to do this is using the \"transitive property\". For example, if Team A beat Team B and Team B beat Team C, then Team A's fans can say \"Since Team A is better than Team B, and Team B is better than Team C, Team A must be better than Team C.\" \n",

Furthermore, if Team A beats Team B, Team B beats Team C, and Team C beats Team A, then the fanbases of all three teams can argue that their team is better than a team they lost to. Of course, arguments about sports are often not based on logic. :P\n",

In general, if Team $A_0$ beat Team $A_1$, Team $A_1$ beat Team $A_2$, ..., and Team $A_{n-1}$ beat Team $A_n$, then Team $A_0$'s fans can claim that Team $A_0$ is better than Team $A_n$. Obviously, the more intermediate teams you need, the less credible the argument sounds.

To do this, the function will first use the `shortest_path()` method to generate a list of teams $[A_0,A_1,\\ldots,A_n]$ which forms the shortest path from `my_team` to `their_team`.
